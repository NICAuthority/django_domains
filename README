This is a super-simple project - I work on a Mac and just run it locally from the built in Django dev server.  It's essentially just a few models and a slightly tweaked admin, but it's been invaluable for helping me manage my dozens of domain and registrar records.

.................

Make sure you have Django installed: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/install/

Update the project settings.py - the only two things you really need to pay attention to are:

 - configuring your db connection

 - setting a path to the project templates folder:

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    '/path/to/django_domains/templates/',
    )

From the 'django_domains' folder, run:

    python manage.py syncdb

Once you've gone through that process, set up your admin user, etc., just start the project and you should be good to go:

    python manage.py runserver
